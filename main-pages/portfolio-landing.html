                        <p>
                            This project was my submission for the CS 370
                            Operating Systems term project.
                            The project rules were to group up into groups
                            of 2-3 people and make something using a
                            Raspberry Pi.
                            In this process I learned a great deal about the
                            development process and how to leverage hardware
                            restrictions.
                            We had the whole term to work so leveraging our
                            time and avalibility to complete the project was
                            another challenge.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We had decided on using our Pi to control a
                            rover and developed a systems through which a
                            user could provide coordinates over a desktop
                            interface, and the rover would seek those
                            coordniates.
                            The program works by establishing a local server
                            using flask on the Raspberry pi. Then the user
                            would access the server via a webpage and type
                            the coordniates. The Pi would then compute the
                            instruction and send orders to an arduino that
                            operates the rover.
                            Not being robotics engineers the rover itself
                            looks rather shabby but luckily functions. Using
                            an onboard battery, a gps sensor, an arduino,
                            and the PI itself its able to navagate to
                            coordnates provided via the web.

                        <p>This one feels pretty self explanatory, but the
                            portfolio website I am refering to is the
                            website you are currently on.
                            This website has gone through three major
                            revisions. The first version followed a Youtube
                            video and relied very heavily on Javascript to
                            function.
                            However after reading a book on web design I
                            learned its probably best to make the website
                            still functional without Javascript.
                            Thus the second version was very basic and
                            relied mostly on its HTML for structure and
                            funtion. This version is the third version and
                            was a complete restart having learned from the
                            other two.
                            This website was built from the bottom up using
                            no outside website making programs.

                            This is my attempt at the producer-consumer
                            problem using bounded buffer.
                            Main starts two threads, producerThread and
                            consumerThread which start the consumer and
                            producer process.
                            producer creates random double 'item' and checks
                            if buffer size is equal to 1000, if it is, it
                            waits for the consumer to consume one element.
                            It adds the item to the buffer and icrements the
                            counter of total produced items and adds the
                            value to the sum of the produced items.
                            consumer removes the oldest value in the buffer,
                            maintains a value of the sum of the consumed
                            items.
                            Finally after enoughed items are consumed main
                            takes the two threads and joins them back
                            together.

                            Assembly. This was completed for use on CSU's
                            LC3 simulator.
                            This program features many of the unique aspects
                            of coding in assembly, the most annoying of
                            which is the importance of good comments.
                            While Assembly is not useful practially anymore
                            as it once was, I beleive this project showcases
                            my knowledge of the underlying functions behind
                            much of coding.

                        This is my favorite poly-modeling project. It is
                        based on a mini gong that I have in my apartment. I
                        have trained my cats to all come once I ring it.
                        I got the symbols directly from my gong by taking a
                        picture adjusting it until I had a clear alpha of
                        the shape of the symbol.

                            This is my high school senior capstone project.
                            At the time I wanted to deticate myself to
                            making a strong urban scene which is something I
                            had never done before this.
                            I had a lot of spare time due to the Covid-19
                            pandemic and thus a lot of hours were poured
                            into this.

                                This scene was created in order for me to
                                attempt at making a rainy window,
                                <span class = "house">House</span>plants, and fancy light-bulbs. Im happy
                                with how those aspects turned out however
                                you can see how i am cutting corners in a
                                couple places.
                                Many of the models in these scene I took
                                from my other projects and because of that
                                can be seen in a couple other scenes as
                                well. The guitar is from before I learned to
                                poly model well, so there is some
                                artifacting.
                                The computer tower was made in under 5
                                minutes and because of that it is easily the
                                weakest part of this. Also the painting on
                                the wall is my favorite paining of all time
                                "City Lights" by Flooko.

                                    fun game, but after a game of it at my
                                    grandparents I decied to try my hand at
                                    modeling our game, with various other
                                    games scattered around of course.

                                    This can of pepsi was the only
                                    remarkable thing to come out of a dining
                                    room scene that I had tried to make.
                                    Particularly love this model because I
                                    managed to get finger prints on it.
                                    Like many others you can see this model
                                    makes it's way into a lot of my scenes.

                                    are the parts that diverge from the

                                    that I saw her using one day. The cup is
                                    vintage and was given away by my
                                    great-uncle and unfortunatly broke after
                                    I modeled it but we can see it here
                                    being put to good use.

                                    actually helped me here.

                                    is based on a drawing online, the second
                                    is based on a atmosphere and space
                                    tutorial.
                                    The grass one is my favorite and is from
                                    when I learned to use alfa to specify
                                    what to texture and what to not.

                                    I downloaded a texture of a man's face
                                    as well as some eyeballs.
                                    I ended up not having the time I needed
                                    to do an actual head so here we are...

                                    Had this ghost hanging next to my desk
                                    for 4+ years until I moved to Fort
                                    Collins. I just recently bought a new
                                    one that proudly hangs in my apartment
                                    from August until November.
